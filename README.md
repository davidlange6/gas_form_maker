# gas_form_maker

Lame example of a building a questionarre from google apps script attached to a google form

How to use?
  * Open a new google form
  * Click the three vertical dots in the very top right for more options
  * Select "Script editor"
  * Copy this code in
  * Save and Run (you will need to accept some permissions)
  * Your form should be filled in now..
  
Clear things to improve
  * Make a full example from CoDas-HEP 2022
  * Split code to define questions from the code to build the form from the questions
  * Make this interface spreadsheet driven? (or better yaml)
  * Support photo sections
  * Support bold text (Seems to be currently impossible..)
